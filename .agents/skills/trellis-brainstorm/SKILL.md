description: "Guides collaborative requirements discovery before implementation. Creates task directory, seeds PRD, asks high-value questions one at a time, researches technical choices, and converges on MVP scope. Use when requirements are unclear, there are multiple valid approaches, or the user describes a new feature or complex task."

# Trellis Brainstorm

## Non-Negotiable Interview Contract

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time.

## Non-Negotiable Evidence Rule

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

This is mandatory. Before asking the user a question, first check whether the answer is already available in code, tests, configs, docs, existing specs, or task history.

Do not ask the user to confirm facts that the repository can answer. Ask only for product intent, preference, scope, risk tolerance, or decisions that remain ambiguous after inspection.

---

Use this skill during Phase 1 planning to turn the user's request into clear requirements and planning artifacts.

## Preconditions

Use this skill only after task-creation consent has been given and the user is ready to enter Trellis planning.

If no task exists yet, create one:

```bash
TASK_DIR=$(python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<short task title>" --slug <slug>)
```

Use a concise title from the user's request. Use a slug without a date prefix. `task.py create` adds the `MM-DD-` directory prefix automatically.

`task.py create` creates the default `prd.md`. Update that file with the current understanding before asking follow-up questions.

## Planning Flow

1. Capture the user's request and initial known facts in `prd.md`.
2. Inspect available evidence before asking questions:
   - code, tests, fixtures, and configs
   - README files, docs, existing specs, and domain notes
   - related Trellis tasks, research files, and session history when present
3. Separate what you found into:
   - confirmed facts
   - product intent still needed from the user
   - scope or risk decisions still needed from the user
   - likely out-of-scope items
4. Ask the single highest-value remaining question.
5. Include your recommended answer with the question.
6. After each user answer, update `prd.md` before continuing.
7. Before declaring planning ready, run the PRD Convergence Gate below.
8. For complex tasks, create or update `design.md` and `implement.md` before implementation starts.

Do not invent a project-specific product/spec hierarchy. If the repository already has product, domain, or spec docs, use them. If it does not, proceed with the evidence that exists.

## Question Rules

Ask only one question per message.

Each question must include:

- the decision needed
- why the answer matters
- your recommended answer
- the trade-off if the user chooses differently

Do not ask process questions such as whether to search, inspect files, or continue brainstorming. Do the evidence work directly. Ask the user only when the remaining issue is a product decision, preference, scope boundary, or risk tolerance choice.

## PRD Convergence Gate

Run this gate after the final meaningful user answer and before asking for approval to start implementation, curating JSONL manifests, or running `task.py start`.

The working `prd.md` is allowed to be messy during discovery. The final `prd.md` is not. Before planning is ready:

1. Compare the current `prd.md` against the final PRD contract in Artifact Rules.
2. Collapse repeated facts, root causes, decisions, and constraints into a single authoritative location.
3. Fold temporary brainstorm sections into final sections:
   - `What I already know` -> confirmed facts or background.
   - `Assumptions` -> confirmed facts, requirements, out of scope, or open questions.
   - Resolved `Open Questions` -> the section that now owns the answer.
4. Keep `Open Questions` only for unresolved blockers that prevent planning or implementation.
5. Merge parallel defect lists and requirement lists when they describe the same work. Preserve each defect's file:line anchors, severity, and evidence inside the owning requirement instead of keeping a second duplicate list.
6. Preserve every file:line anchor, decision, requirement id, acceptance criterion, and AC-to-requirement mapping. Deduplication must be lossless.
7. Move design detail out of `prd.md` into `design.md` for complex tasks, unless the detail is a requirement, compatibility constraint, or user-visible acceptance condition.

Do not remove content merely because it looks verbose. Remove or move content only when the same fact is already represented in the final structure or belongs in another planning artifact.

## Artifact Rules

`prd.md` records requirements and acceptance:

- goal and user value
- confirmed facts
- requirements
- acceptance criteria
- out of scope
- open questions that still block planning

`design.md` records technical design for complex tasks:

- architecture and boundaries
- data flow and contracts
- compatibility and migration notes
- important trade-offs
- operational or rollback considerations

`implement.md` records execution planning for complex tasks:

- ordered implementation checklist
- validation commands
- risky files or rollback points
- follow-up checks before `task.py start`

Lightweight tasks may have only `prd.md`. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.

`implement.md` is not a replacement for `implement.jsonl`. Use JSONL files only for manifest-style spec and research references when the task needs them.

## Quality Bar

Before declaring planning ready:

- `prd.md` contains testable acceptance criteria.
- `prd.md` has passed the PRD Convergence Gate: no duplicate temporary brainstorm sections remain, and no evidence or mapping was lost.
- Repository-answerable questions have already been answered through inspection.
- Remaining open questions are genuinely about user intent or scope.
- Complex tasks have `design.md` and `implement.md`.
- The user has reviewed the final planning artifacts or explicitly approved proceeding.

Do not start implementation until the user approves or asks for implementation.
